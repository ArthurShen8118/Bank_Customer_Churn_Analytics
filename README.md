## Motivation
Customer’s experience is one of the important concern for bank industries. This project presents a deep learning approach to analyse which factors contribute to customer churn and also to improve the customer’s experience and help banks to securely retain customers. 

 



## TechStack used


- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


##  Dataset


This dataset consists of __100000 customers__ details.

The dataset were collected from the following sources:

* __Kaggle datasets__ 


## Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## Features
ＩA method to use the dataset from Kaggle to train the predication model by Artificial Neural Network. Also, we use the test_dataset splited from dataset to do the test and get the good result.
